This Project is designed for people who want to visibly see how different modes of investment can pay out.

This project is not complete but is being added to on a regular basis.

Current you can add Compound Interest Accounts and Loan Accounts.

Loan Accounts are easy to showcase the use of the chart; However Compound accounts are a bit trickier, In order to display a Compound you must add two events on at the start and one at the end.
